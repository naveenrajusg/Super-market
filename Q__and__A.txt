1) What is the purpose of using multiple anchors per feature map cell?
Answer:
-In general real time senarios while training the model to detect general objects for example such as car,humans.
Both have completely different aspect ratios i.e one is wider and other is narrow respectively.Thus if we train model with only one aspect ratio and single scale which form only single type of anchor for each cell of feature map thus causing model to fail to converge.

-Condition 1:-If in a perticular place of feature map has 2 or 1 different types of objects, during training time when we map generated anchors(based on scales and ratios) to its maximum overlap respective ground truth in this condition the generated anchor always fails to get mapped to the class having different aspect ratio,thus that perticular anchor majority of times get tagged as negative anchor(because of low iou overlap) thus even the regressor values will not be cosidered(as regressions values will not be calculated for negative classses).Therefore it hampers both classification loss and regression loss.Thus the classification values and regression values generated by the architecture CNN layers based on feature maps(even though its predicting correct in somestage of training) it gets ignored by considering it as wrong.

-Condition 2:-If in a perticular place of feature map has an object of different aspect ratio, during training time when we map generated anchors(based on scales and ratios) to its maximum overlap respective ground truth in this condition,even though the anchor gets taged as positive, its ground truth and anchor calculated offset values(difference between cordinates of anchors and ground truth boxes) will be large thus hampering the convergence of regression loss(i.e is cordinated predicted by feature maps of CNN layers). 



2)Does this problem require multiple anchors?
Answer:
-In general real time senarios in the supermarket there exists many products arranged in shelves having wide range of aspect ratios, thus if we train using only one aspect ratio and scale per featur map respetively(i.e one anchor per feature map cell) it will become difficult for a model to converge bounding box values to its best fit. 

-Thus its always good to train with atleast reasonable best number of anchors per feature map cell keeping in mind that not using large number of anchors because it may affect inference time on edge devices.

-Since the given dataset din't have large variations in aspect ratios and scales, large number of anchor raios and scales was not required.

-If only the objective is to calulate total number of products ,even though the boxes are not accurate to products its fine but if we want to classify the brands on images we need exact box predictions from model so that we can crop that region and classify it corectly,if we get inaccurate box dimension output there is a chance of brandlogo getting cropped out thus causing classification problems.

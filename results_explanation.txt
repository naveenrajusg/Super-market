After applying non max supression for predictions with iou thresh of 0.2 for nms and filtering predictions on 0.4 score threshold,now after calculating recall and precision on 0.6 as iou threshold i got precision of 99 and recall of 95.6 on test set.

Using iou thresholds of 0.6,0.65,0.7,0.75,0.8,0.85 i got average recall of 72.43 and average precision of 74.99
